{\itshape The King has died under mysterious circumstances. The
  kingdom is in tumult as different factions maneuver their preferred
  person toward the empty throne.  Whoever is selected will have a
  tenuous grasp on the reins of the kingdom and may not survive long.

  But you will be perfectly safe. You are one of the advisors---the force
  behind the throne. By manipulating the relationships among the
  various potential rulers, you can ensure that your favored
  choice comes out on top.
